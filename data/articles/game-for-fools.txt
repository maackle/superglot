The first moment you hesitate
Better ask yourself why
Don't you wait until it's too late
Until something inside has died
When you're paralysed, no direction at all
Found yourself way up high
Now there's only space to fall
When you're losing
Even when you know the rules
Must be a game for fools

Coz the
The first moment you hesitate
Better ask yourself why
Don't you wait until it's too late
Until something inside has died

Ooh

Yeah it's easy down the line
To make a map of your lies
But you can't keep on
Keep on keeping the truth sponsored links

 
Well disguised
Acting like it was alright
When it was all wrong

And you feel you've wasted so much time 
Forever
Trying to make up your mind
Now it's clear you should have just moved on
Simply packed your bags and gone

Coz the
The first moment you hesitate
You can kiss those plans goodbye
Don't you wait until it's too late
Or something inside might die

If you're losing
When you know
Yeah you know all the rules
Must be playing a game for fools

Congratulations

Yeah you're winning the game 
For fools
