From Devon:

The Arabs are really unmotivated. They need motivation.
They don't do any homework.
They love to do things on the computer.
The teachers at the school really want some help. It seems dire.
They're really bad at reading.

The school has tried other software solutions. They have a computer lab that nobody seems to use. They had some really comprehensive immersion learning software for $3000/month that virtually nobody used.

Consequently the owner of the school is pretty wary of spending a bunch of money on software. Also they are moving from downtown to Lloyd Center, in the fall, so all focus and nervousness is going towards that currently.

Superglot would be best for use as a homework aid/self-study tool.

The goal is to get the teachers interested, so they can introduce it to the students individually. This is ideal because I need beta testers, and this will give us a real study of how it benefits students compared to those who don't use superglot.

Points of excitement:
- Seeing words in context.
- Seeing definitions.

Pain points:
- Having to find and load texts.
- Wanting to be able to see words in context in various texts.
