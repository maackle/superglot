VOCAB RE-STRUCTURE
==================

Problems:
	hash-based updating needs to work differently for two cases:
		- updating a user's words from a list
		- annotating a document's words


GENERAL DECISIONS
=================

Should word-equivalence be lemma or reading based, and when?
	- Does a user know a Lemma or a Reading? (I think Lemma)


PARSING DOCUMENTS
=================

Differentiate style tags from structure tags for plaintext sentence structure
	- allow <i>, <a>, <span>, etc. to stay on same line, same sentence
	- force newline for <div>

Content detection
	- Ignore navbar
	- Find actual content


PARSING WORDS
=============

Problem cases
-------------

Moby Dick ch 1
	me—since
	it—would
	fowls;—though
	wanting?—Water—there


DOCUMENT DETAIL
===============

Stats for documents need to account for duplicate words (100% comprehension currently not possible)
