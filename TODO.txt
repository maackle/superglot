GENERAL DECISIONS
=================

Should word-equivalence be lemma or reading based, and when?
	- Does a user know a Lemma or a Reading? (I think Lemma)


PARSING DOCUMENTS
=================

Differentiate style tags from structure tags for plaintext sentence structure
	- allow <i>, <a>, <span>, etc. to stay on same line, same sentence
	- force newline for <div>

Content detection
	- Ignore navbar
	- Find actual content
